# Air Pollution in India using Tableau

## Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and analyze air pollution data in India, and visualize the findings using Tableau.

## Top 10 Mean AQI Cities
This visualization displays the top 10 cities in India with the highest mean Air Quality Index (AQI). The cities are ranked in descending order, with their respective AQI values and a color-coded legend indicating the level of pollution.
