## Count of AQI Safe and Unsafe Levels
Delhi and Gurugram have unsafe AQI levels over than 85% of all time which is dangerously high . Accoreding to WHO ,
The specific disease outcomes most strongly linked with exposure to air pollution include stroke, ischaemic heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, pneumonia, and cataract (household air pollution only).  

There is suggestive evidence also linking air pollution exposure with increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes (i.e. low-birth weight, small for gestational age), other cancers, diabetes, cognitive impairment and neurological diseases
